                <p class="content">Capstone You are to build a TV Channel Scheduler. The Scheduler works for family members who want to record their favorite TV series so that they can watch them later and get notified by the Scheduler when they have time (it knows their availability slots - randomly initialized). There are N members in a family, each having their favorite series out of a total of M. Multiple members may love the same series. However, the Scheduler cannot schedule a series if there is a conflict of interest. Also, members want to get on time for p slots. The Scheduler needs to minimize total episode misses.</p>

                <p class="content">Our Calculus Project delves into the study of how rumors spread within a stable population group. To accomplish this we are using mathematical modeling to represent the spread of information. The model aims to improve understanding on how to track the spread of rumors and further on how to control it. The factors influencing the spread of rumors will be defined in the project. The project will incorporate graph theory and differential equations to model interactions within a stable population. The findings and conclusions of this project have implications for diverse fields, the project aims to close the gap between a real-world social phenomena and its mathematical model .</p>
